The above project is an in-depth analysis of E-commerce supply chain data in which I have made a visualisation of the price of the products and revenue generated by them,
analyzed the sales by product type, total revenue generated from shipping carriers, analyzed the revenue generated by each stock keeping unit, 
analyzed the order quantity of each stock keeping unit, analyzed the shipping cost of carriers,
identified the cost distribution by transportation mode and analyzed the defect rate of the product during shipping.
Also leveraged the data visualization and data manipulation library of python like pandas and plotly to create interactive visualizations, such as scatter plots and pie charts,
for the better understanding of product performance and sales trends to deliver actionable insights to optimize supply chain efficiency and enhance decision making.

This project provided a comprehensive analysis of E-commerce supply chain data, uncovering critical insights into product pricing, revenue trends, and logistics performance. 
Through the use of Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries like pandas and plotly,
I was able to create interactive visualizations such as scatter plots and pie charts, making the data more interpretable for stakeholders.
